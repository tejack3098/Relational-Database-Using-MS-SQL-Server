## Massachusetts Courier Service Management System

- The Massachusetts Courier Service Management System is a project aimed at providing an efficient platform for customers to order and track courier services for sending goods from a source location to a specified destination. 
- The system's main objectives are to provide timely notification updates to customers, effective time management, location-specific services, and varied payment options. 
- With this system, customers can easily track the activities of their shipments, such as booking, delivery, and status checks, without having to constantly be in touch with the courier office.

## Implementation

- Designed and implemented a relational database for a Courier Service Management System to be used by a Web Application.
- Built the EER diagram, Normalized the data and mapped the Conceptual Model to the Relational Model. Implemented the Relational Model into a Physical database using Microsoft SQL Server.
- Analyzed Key Performance Indicators using Tableau to assess a company's performance using graphs, charts, and other visual aids that depict the KPIs' values over time.
